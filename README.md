# Accessibility-Challenge
This repo holds the week 1 Horiseon Accessibility Challenge

## Motivation
* to assure that the code provided meets Web Accessibility standards
* I worked on this project for the purpose of implementing my newly learned Html and Css skills 
* In this project I learned the importance of the boy scout rule which is of course to leave code cleaner than you found it. 

## Installation

Because the code provided is for a web based application no installations are required for the code to work. 

## Credits

I had no collaborators for this project, however I did use reference material to better understand what each part of the html did. I will provide the links for those references below.
